# Linked List
ADV
- No resize
- add(0) is O(1)
- Exactly much memory as needed
DISADV
- Random access is O(n)
- add expensive

# Array List
ADV
- Random access is fast af
- add(`end`) is O(1) [O(n) if resizing]
- efficient memory
DISADV
- add(0) is O(n)
- resizing

# We iterate through Lists a lot.
